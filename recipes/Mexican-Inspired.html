    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 medium red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 medium green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups long grain white rice, uncooked</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®), liquid drained and reserved</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups frozen green peas, thawed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine salt, granulated garlic, cumin, paprika, coriander, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Sprinkle seasoning mix evenly over both sides of chicken thighs.</li>
        <li>Combine butter and olive oil in a deep-sided, 11-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; cook until butter is melted and foamy. Swirl the butter and oil together and place chicken thighs in the skillet in a single layer. Cook until just brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from the pan with tongs and set aside. Keep warm.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add onion and bell peppers to the skillet. Cook, stirring often, until the onion starts to turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in rice and chili powder; cook and stir until rice begins to pick up some color, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in drained tomatoes and garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add reserved tomato liquid, chicken broth, and water; bring to a boil. Adjust salt and pepper if necessary.</li>
        <li>Place browned chicken thighs on top of the rice mixture; do not submerge. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove cover, increase heat to medium, and gently stir in thawed peas. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
